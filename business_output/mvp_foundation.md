# QRON Living QR Art - MVP Business Foundation

## 1. Customer Persona

**Name:** Sarah Chen, "The Savvy Small Business Owner"

**Pain Point:** Sarah, who runs a boutique online clothing store, struggles to create engaging, trackable marketing materials.

She wants to stand out, attract more customers to her online store, and understand what marketing efforts are actually driving sales, all without needing a dedicated marketing team or large budget.

**Budget:** $50 - $150/month for marketing tools. She's willing to pay for value that directly impacts her sales and brand image.
