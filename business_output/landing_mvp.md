## 3 Pain Points

### Pain Point 1: Your QR Codes Are Invisible & Ignored.
*   **Description:** Traditional black-and-white QR codes blend into the background, failing to capture attention and often go unscanned. You invest in marketing, but your QR codes aren't pulling their weight.
*   **QRON Solution:** AI-generated, artistic QRONs stand out, making your marketing materials impossible to ignore.

### Pain Point 2: You're Blind to What Works.
*   **Description:** You have no idea who's scanning your QR codes, where they're coming from, or if your campaigns are actually driving results. Marketing without data is just guesswork.
*   **QRON Solution:** QRON provides real-time scan analytics, offering deep insights into your audience and campaign performance.

### Pain Point 3: Your Campaigns Are Static in a Dynamic World.
*   **Description:** Once printed, your QR codes are fixed. Changing promotions, updating links, or adapting to new audiences means reprinting, costing time and money.
*   **QRON Solution:** With Dynamic Redirects and Living Art, your QRONs evolve. Update links, change destinations based on device or time, or schedule visual transformations – all without reprinting.
