# Project Completion Summary and Next Steps

The `qron-app` project has been successfully deployed to Vercel with its core features implemented and critical issues resolved.

## Accomplishments:

*   **Project Setup & Features:**
    *   The application's structure (`qron-starter-v2`) has been established.
    *   A feature-rich homepage is live, incorporating the new product positioning ("Artistic, on-brand QR experiences that increase scans and engagement"), data points (20-30% lift in scan rates), and a gallery with "micro case studies".
    *   The pricing model (`lib/plans.ts`) now reflects "Free", "Pro", and "Enterprise" subscription tiers.
    *   A functional QRON generator UI (`app/page.tsx`) integrates with the backend generation API, allowing selection of QRON modes and Fal.ai presets.
    *   A dedicated `presets` API endpoint (`app/api/presets/route.ts`) is in place.
*   **Bug Fixes & Code Quality:**
    *   All critical build errors, including module resolution and path imports, have been resolved.
    *   Key linting errors, such as `any` type usage and `useEffect` dependency issues in components like `FolderManager.tsx`, `LivingArtScheduler.tsx`, `RedirectRulesManager.tsx`, and `TagManager.tsx`, have been fixed. (Minor warnings remain but do not block functionality).
*   **Deployment:**
    *   The application has been successfully deployed to Vercel.
    *   **Live URL:** `https://www.qron.space` (aliased)
    *   **Vercel Deployment URL:** `https://qron-ewuzf87il-zacharys-projects-3d5fcafd.vercel.app`
*   **Integrations:**
    *   Stripe payment gateway is integrated for processing subscriptions.
    *   Supabase Auth is the foundation for user authentication.
    *   Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights have been integrated for monitoring application performance and user engagement.

## Next Steps & User Actions Required:

To ensure full functionality and successful operation of your QRON.space platform, please address the following:

1.  **Stripe Webhook Configuration:**
    *   **Action:** Go to your Stripe Dashboard ([https://dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com)) -> "Developers" -> "Webhooks".
    *   **Endpoint:** Add an endpoint that points to your deployed application's webhook URL (e.g., `https://www.qron.space/api/webhook`).
    *   **Secret:** Copy the generated "Signing secret" and update the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable in your Vercel project settings and your local `.env.local` file. This is crucial for payment confirmation.
2.  **Supabase Database Setup:**
    *   **Action:** Ensure your Supabase project's database is correctly structured with all necessary tables (`profiles`, `qrons`, `living_art_schedules`, `redirect_rules`, `tags`, `folders`).
    *   **Command:** Run `supabase db push` as per the `qron-starter-v2` instructions to apply migrations to your Supabase project.
3.  **Complete API Key Configuration:**
    *   **Action:** Ensure all required API keys are set in your Vercel project's environment variables (and your local `.env.local` for development). These include:
        *   `FAL_KEY` (required for AI QR generation)
        *   `RUNWAY_API_KEY` (for Kinetic video QR codes)
        *   `CHIRP_API_KEY` (for Ultrasonic Echo mode)
        *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID` (for NFT Minting Memory QRONs)
        *   `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (for server-side Supabase operations)
        *   `RESEND_API_KEY` / `SENDGRID_API_KEY` (for email functionalities, if enabled)
4.  **Thorough Testing:**
    *   **Action:** Test all 11 unique QRON modes on the deployed application (`https://www.qron.space`) to confirm they function as expected with their respective integrations.
    *   **Action:** Manually test the Stripe payment flow using test card numbers to ensure successful redirection and webhook processing.
5.  **Analytics Integration (Plausible.io):**
    *   **Action:** If you intend to use Plausible.io, ensure its setup and integration are complete as per its documentation.

By completing these steps, your QRON.space platform will be fully operational and ready to serve your users.
